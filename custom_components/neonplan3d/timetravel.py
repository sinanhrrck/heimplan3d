"""Time travel (Pro): the past states of the plan's entities from Home Assistant's recorder.

One request covers at most a day (plus a margin) and a list of entities: states with their kept
attributes (see timetravel_rows.ATTR_KEEP), numeric measurements as five-minute means. The answer is
compact (columns of offsets, value indices and a value table), so a wall tablet can hold a day of a
whole house in a few hundred kilobytes.
