### Highlights

- **Plan editor in Home Assistant** – floors, rooms, automatic walls, doors, windows and garage doors with sensors, stairs and floor openings, outdoor areas, roof, a floor plan image as template, and the 3D view next to the plan while you draw.
- **Live 3D view** – tap to switch, swipe to dim or move blinds, long press for colours and positions; lamps light their rooms in their colours, windows tilt and open, doors swing, TVs and appliances glow while they run.
- **40 built-in furniture models and lamps**, room packages that furnish a room in one go, parking spots with vehicles, a robot vacuum that drives its lanes.
- **Cameras** on walls and ceilings with their field of view on the floor, red on motion, snapshots with a tap.
- **Wall tablet ready** – warnings (smoke, gas, CO, water, alarm, windows open in the rain), kiosk mode with idle return, night dimming and a screensaver turn, scene buttons, a *Tablet* quality level, zero frames while idle.
- **Dashboard card** with a visual editor, three looks (Neon, Blueprint, Day), heatmap, sunlight through the windows, search, restore points and a full backup.
