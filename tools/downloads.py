"""How often the Mastershort integrations were installed or updated through HACS: the download counts
of the release zip of every GitHub release (HACS downloads exactly this file, see zip_release in
hacs.json).

    python tools/downloads.py                       (all repos below; needs the GitHub CLI "gh")
    python tools/downloads.py cyd-studio            (one repo)

Each install and each update counts once; the sum over all releases is therefore "installs + updates",
the newest release's count roughly the installations that are up to date.
